# Make IoT - Build IoT Apps

A wrapper around `debootstrap` to build lightweight IoT Apps.


## Build Spec

`mkiot` make it simple to build IoT apps artifacts that are ready to be deployed to IoT devices.

Internally It uses `debootstrap` and other classic Linux tools. `mkiot` provides these benefits:

* Produces classic archives format: `zip` and `tar` files.

* Supports multi-stage builds to produce lightweight IoT apps.

* Only the build envrionment is defined, the execution environment is not defined nor enforced.


### Build Spec syntax

Build specs are expressed in [YAML](https://yaml.org) format.

If a field contains a character, or a string of characters, that is not supported by YAML,
you must enclose the command in quotation marks (""). The following command is enclosed in
quotation marks because a colon (:) followed by a space is not allowed in YAML.
The quotation mark in the command is escaped (\"). [1] Reference.

```bash
"export PACKAGE_NAME=$(cat package.json | grep name | head -1 | awk -F: '{ print $2 }' | sed 's/[\",]//g')"
```


IoT buildspec format:

```yaml

```


* `version`: represents the buildspec version. Required field.

* `arch`: required fields represents the target board architecture. Possible values are: `i386`, `amd64`, `armhf` and `arm64`.

* `build-directory`: required field represents the location where to produce builds.

* `env`: optional field contains environment variables that are passed to all commands of the buildpsec. The environment variables are inside `variables` as keys and values.

* `cache`: optional cache where to find previous images that were downloaded and cached. This allows to not download images again. By default it is set to `/var/lib/mkiot/images/cache/`.

* `phases`: Represents the different phases of a build. This is a required field must contain the `installs` phase and at least one of the `pre-builds`, `builds` or `post-builds` phases.

    * `installs`: a list of different images to install tht are necessary to build and produce the application artifact.
    * This should be used to only download images or use the ones from the cache to install packages.

        * `image`: required field in `installs` contains the base distribution name to use as a file system for the application.

        * `mirror`: optional field to define the mirror where to download the distribution from.

        * `release`: optional field to define the release code name of distribution to use.

        * `cache`: optional field to specify how to use the cache. Possible values are `save`, `reuse` or both separated by `,`. Save means after finishing downloading this image and executing the commands save it into cache for future usage. Reuse means if this image is in the cache do not download it again and just copy it to the `build-directory` and use it.

        * `commands`: optional sequence of commands with their arguments that are executed according to their order. Command example: `["/bin/echo", "hello"]`.

    * `pre-builds`: optional sequence of commands to prepare the build environment.

        * `use`: the name of the image to use. It has to be the `name` field of one of the images that were installed during the `installs` phase.

        * `commands`: optional sequence of commands with their arguments that are executed according to their order. Command example: `["/bin/echo", "hello"]`.

    * `builds`: optional sequence of commands to build the application.

        * `use`: the name of the image to use. It has to be the `name` field of one of the images that were installed during the `installs` phase.

        * `commands`: optional sequence of commands with their arguments that are executed according to their order. Command example: `["/bin/echo", "hello"]`.

    * `post-builds`: optional sequence of commands to run after the build. These can be used to produce final files necesary to build the artifact, clean up files or even push notifications.

        * `use`: the name of the image to use. It has to be the `name` field of one of the images that were installed during the `installs` phase.

        * `commands`: optional sequence of commands with their arguments that are executed according to their order. Command example: `["/bin/echo", "hello"]`.




### Build specs extra documentation
        
#### Commands

Commands are sequences that are executed inside the image or the build environment one at a time, in the order listed.
Each command can be any command that refers to a binary or shell command inside the image, beside that there are some
special commands that will make it easy to automate the build process

* `script`: the script command allows to pass directly a script inside the image and execute it, it is done by bind mounting the script inside the image. This is useful instead of passing multiple sequences of commands; the commands are inside the script file which is executed. The script can be either `bash`, `python` etc.

    * `script` syntax: the `script` command syntax is: `[ "script", "scriptfile", "/bin/scriptfile" ]`, where the first element is the command, the second element is the script file location, and last one which is optional is where to make it available inside the image. Usually copying it into `/bin/` inside image is enough which is the default operation anyway if the third element is not specified.
