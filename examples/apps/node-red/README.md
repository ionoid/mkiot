# Deploy Node-RED to your Raspberry Pis and IoT Devices

![Node-RED](./node-red-logo.png)

[Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways.


## Node-RED Debian Based Image

To build Node-RED for `ARM` architectures and produce an artifact, we use the following:

- [Node-RED Buildspec yaml file](./debian/buster//node-red_node-14_minimal_debian_armhf.yaml)
- [Node.js install script](debian/buster/node-install.sh)

- [Node-RED app.yaml file](./app.yaml)


To build Node-RED artifact, make sure you are in this directory:

```bash
cd examples/apps/node-red/
sudo mkiot build debian/buster/node-red_node-14_minimal_debian_armhf.yaml
```

### Test Node-RED locally

```bash
sudo systemd-nspawn -D output/node_minimal_debian-buster_armhf/
node-red
```

Then open your browser at [http://127.0.0.1:1880/](http://127.0.0.1:1880/)


## Node-RED Alpine Based Image

To build Node-RED artifact based on Alpine, make sure to be in this directory and start the build:

```bash
cd examples/apps/node-red/
sudo mkiot build alpine/node-red_minimal_alpine_armhf.yaml
```


## Deploy Node-RED to IoT Devices

To deploy your Node-RED artifact to your devices:

1. Locate your artifact, shoud be inside directory `output`:
```bash
./output/artifacts/node-red_node-14_minimal_debian_armhf.tar
```

2. Upload your artifact to internet, and make sure that it is accessible.

3. Use [Ionoid.io Deploy App](https://docs.ionoid.io/docs/deploy-iot-apps.html) feature to deploy and run Node-RED on
your IoT Devices.
